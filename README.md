### Learn how to use crud method with express.

I made a clone data with express . In this code you can use crud method. Like get,put,post and delete method.

if you will be using post and delete method so you have to use postman app. without postman you cannot post and check your code.

besically, we need a postman app because browser only accept html code and get code Browser can't accept post and delete method.

I use splice keyword in delete method because I need to delete specific postion and splice onl the way to delete value by index.
